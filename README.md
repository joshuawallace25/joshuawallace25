I am a passionate Flutter developer with over two years of experience building innovative mobile applications. My expertise lies in state management using GetX, crafting responsive UI/UX designs, and integrating modern features like Google Maps, Firebase, and RFID systems. I thrive on delivering structured, high-performance apps for a wide range of industries, from student management systems to mental health chatbots.

Currently, I'm working on projects such as an admin-student financial management app, an RFID-based attendance system, and a chatbot for health and wellness. My approach is always user-focused, combining cutting-edge tech with a clean, maintainable code structure. With a strong foundation in project organization and a detail-oriented mindset, I aim to develop impactful solutions that simplify complex workflows.
